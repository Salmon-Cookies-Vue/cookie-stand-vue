# JS Framework Comparative Analysis

## Vue

### Research Conducted By: Ashley Moore, Matt Ravenmoore, Garrett Cintron

### Overall Score and Comments

#### Score (Out of 10): 5

#### General Comments

Vue is a front-end framework it is an (MVVM)--model view, view-model. 

Properties need to be created at the root level and can only be passsed in one direction which made managing state challenging. 

Vue was challening to use for a simple application and would better serve a larger scale, more complex application. 

Our general consensus our biggest challenge was passing state. The other elements of the project were easy to build out.

#### Pros

* The average learning time for beginners is 5-6 days which would give it a fast learning curve
* AWS friendly
* Flexible

#### Cons

* Structuring code felt pretty cumbersome. 
* Limited Resources, lack of experienced developers

### Ratings and Reviews

Vue ranks 7th on stack Overflow and Storyblok rates vue as #1 for the top JS frameworks of 2020 [check it out!](https://www.storyblok.com/tp/top-javascript-frameworks-2020)

Overall, we think that vue has a lot of potential once we get more familiar with it!

#### Documentation

Vues documentation was easy to read and robust. The only downside was (as mentioned before), the lack of experienced developers meant there was less information available when debugging.

#### Systems Requirements

Single file with no dependencies :sunglasses:

#### Ramp-Up Projections

How long would/should it take a team of mid-junior developers to become productive?

Since it takes, on average 5-6 days to learn vue, in 2-weeks productivity should be moving steadily along.

#### Community Support and Adoption levels

Vue was created by Google and has seen a trend in useage (although 35% of survey takers prefer React). In addition to Google, Nintendo is another big name in tech and gaming that has adopted Vue.
